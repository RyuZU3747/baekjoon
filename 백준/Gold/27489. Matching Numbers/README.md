### 문제 설명

<p>You are given an integer $n$. Pair the integers $1$ to $2n$ (i.e. each integer should be in exactly one pair) so that each sum of matched pairs is consecutive and distinct. </p>

<p>Formally, let $(a_i, b_i)$ be the pairs that you matched. $\{a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, a_n, b_n\}$ should be a permutation of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$. Let the sorted list of $\{a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \ldots, a_n+b_n\}$ be $s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_n$. We must have $s_{i+1}-s_i = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n - 1$.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.</p>

<p>For each test case, a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) is given.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, if it is impossible to make such a pairing, print "No".</p>

<p>Otherwise, print "Yes" followed by $n$ lines.</p>

<p>At each line, print two integers that are paired.</p>

<p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.</p>

<p>If there are multiple solutions, print any.</p>
